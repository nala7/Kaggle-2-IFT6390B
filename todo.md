# TODO

- add checkpoints to pretrained
- try data augmentation through transformations
- see confusion matrix, see if its better to have 2 stages of classification (normal or not) then (if not, which type)
- improve SVM with cuda so that it takes less to train...

## try multistage classification

- Stage 1: Healthy vs Non-Healthy
- Stage 2: Choroidal Neovascularization vs Others
- Stage 3: Diabetic Macular Edema vs Drusen
